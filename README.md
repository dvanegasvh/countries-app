# Architecture and organization
### Project
I wanted to use a frontend architecture based on Clean Architecture and try to use the SOLID Principle especially the Simple Responsibility because I really like to have the whole application componetized and try not to use global files when it is not necessary besides not having functions with a lot of things to do I also prefer to extract the logic of the components out of it, for that I used custom hooks.

### Version control
For this case I selected a monrepo to host all the code of both the frontend and the backend, separating them into two independent folders.

# Why did I create an api?
Firstly because I find the code cleaner from the frontend, also I can have all the data ready to use and also because I like the backend ‚≠ê

# Somethings to improve
- Better error handling
- Implement cache in the API to improve the request time
- Implement strong CI/CD
- Compositeize much more the css in tailwind
